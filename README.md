 bot base for discord, made complicated.

 any prs would be appreciated

 (someone help me optimize cooldowns please (and overall code))
# how to use
put token in .env

if you want to use "whitelisted" commands, put your user id in the "WHITELIST" field in .env, seperate multiple user ids with comma ","

`npm install` then `npm run start`

ignore the ./tsc directory. edit files in the main code (ts files). reload commands at runtime with `<prefix>reload`
